Handy knowing what's playing without having iTunes open, an information radiator for a shared office radio, 'now playing' screen at an awesome party. It's also&hellip;

* 100% client side - Made out of Javascript, CSS and HTML, no server side stuff. Easy to check out and run locally.
* Super adapatable - It renders well on all devices, big monitors, laptops, phones, tablets and even on the kindle.
* Totally real time - Well, it's polling, but it feels pretty snappy.

h2. Todo

Some small and large improvements I plan make, in rough order:

* Position footer absolutely, to avoid it jumping about
* Add page context username/link to top header
* Adjust default font sizes on extreme devices (mobile / large monitors) for optimal line length
* Improved context in title bar for easy tab referencing
* Improve speed of track change. Smart polling, setup an additional, higher frequency, polling window around the track end (based on duration)
* Adding more metadata (album art, bio, tags, etc) but keep the default view minimal. Probably a click/key interaction that launches a modal.
